# Bike Buyers Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using Excel through a real-world dataset of bike buyers.  
The goal was to clean data, generate insights, and build an interactive dashboard that helps answer business questions such as:

- Who buys bikes more often?
- Does income affect purchasing behavior?
- How does age, gender, and commute distance influence sales?
- Which demographics are most valuable?

All analysis was done using Microsoft Excel (no external tools).
